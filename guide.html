        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of a produce tracker is to be able to identify agriculture hotspots that might be damaging to
            the
            environment. When we pick a produce in a supermarket, we have very little idea how far it has traveled much
            less
            whether it is an outcome of deforestation or pollution or unsustainable practices. There are only fragmented
            information on country-produce environmental issues. But a comprehensive tool that provides a global trade
            of
            produce is largely absent.

        </p><p>
            Such a global data can be found at one site. Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations, gathers and
            publishes various agriculture data at faostat.org. There is a simple visualization tool and the data can be
            downloaded. However, to produce a comprehensive view, the data needs to be prepared and merged of crop
            metrics -
            production, import and export quantities against country and year.
        </p><p>
            The first version of this tool used the production as well as trade(export and import) data by country by
            crop
            by year. It is important to visualize all these three metrics side by side for useful analysis. This will
            help
            in giving a breakthrough for further investigation. Some scenarios to look for are - high export of a
            produce
            (investigate trade, monopoly, deforestation), unusually high import of one or two produce (trade imbalance),
            impact on a produce-country of trade policies (soy export of US to China due to tariffs - which country is
            likely to increase production of soy to meet the demand).
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
        <p>The recommended analysis is to start with the Produce Analysis tab and click on View by produce.</p>
        <p><i>Note: The visualization updates dynamically as you select the view options. </i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick a metric - Production or Export or Import</li>
            <li>Pick a produce of interest and year</li>
            <li>(Optional visualization) - Animate the results trending over years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This first analysis will give the information on country of interest based on the produce. For example, you
            might
            start with understanding top coffee exporters and want to further explore a country of interest. </p>
        <p><i>Note: The visualization updates dynamically as you select the view options. </i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the View by country </li>
            <li>Pick a metric - production or export or import</li>
            <li>Pick a country</li>
            <li>Pick a year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helps in understanding what else is produced (or exported or imported) in that country. </p>
        <p>Once you have narrowed a produce and a country of interest then go to the Time Analysis tab. You can see how
            the
            produce in that country trended over time. </p>

        <h3>Sample Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Try the top producer of Pineapple for year 2014/15. </li>
            <li>Try top exported of Pineapple for the same year. </li>
            <li>Trend the Pineapple and the country of interest. </li>
            <li>You will see Brazil and Costa Rica on the top.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The agricultural practices behind the abundance of pineapple trade expose deforestation of land that is
            cleared
            to make way for more pineapple crops and unethical treatment of workers who handpick pineapples under the
            hot
            sun.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Country (sometimes you may see aggregate regions like Western EU, South Asia etc.)</li>
            <li>Item (this is the produce, at the moment it is all agricultural produce)</li>
            <li>Year (2000 to 2016) </li>
        </ul>
        <h5><i>Measures</i></h5>
